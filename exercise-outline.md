## Contactless tram ticketing ##

Every passenger has a card.

Every tram has one or more card readers.

The passenger touches their card against the card reader when they get on the tram, 
and they touch their card against the card reader again when they get off the tram.

Passengersâ€™ accounts are charged by distance travelled.
