## Charging for distance ##

Every tram stop has a number, and a cardreader knows the number of the last tram stop passed.  
The cost of a journey is £0.30 per stop travelled.

e.g.

| get on at tram stop | get off at tram stop | total charge |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| 8 | 15 | £2.10 |
| 15 | 17 | £0.60 |
| 19 | 20 | £0.30 |
