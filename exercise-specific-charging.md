Charging for distance

Every tram stop has a number, and a cardreader knows the number of the last tram stop passed.  
The cost of a journey is £0.30 per stop travelled.

e.g.
|| get on at tram stop || get off at tram stop || total charge ||
| 8 | 15 | £2.10 |

get on at stop 8, off at stop 15: £2.10
get on at stop 15, off at stop 17: £0.60
get on at stop 19, off at 20: £0.30
